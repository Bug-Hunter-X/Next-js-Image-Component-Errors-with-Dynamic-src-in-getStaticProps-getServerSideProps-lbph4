# Next.js Image Component Error with Dynamic src in getStaticProps/getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Next.js applications. When using the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions to fetch image sources dynamically, invalid URLs or paths can lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures in the `Image` component.

## The Problem

Dynamically generating the `src` prop for Next.js's `Image` component within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` introduces a risk. If the dynamic value is incorrect (e.g., a malformed URL or a path that Next.js cannot resolve), you won't get a clear error message; instead, the image simply won't render.

## The Solution

Implement robust input validation and error handling. Before passing the dynamic `src` to the `Image` component, carefully check its validity, handling potential issues like:

* **Invalid URLs:** Use a regular expression or a URL parsing library to verify the URL's format.
* **Missing Images:** Check if the image exists at the specified URL or path before rendering.
* **Fallback Images:** Provide a default or placeholder image if the dynamic source is invalid.
* **Error Boundaries:** Wrap your component in an error boundary to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.
